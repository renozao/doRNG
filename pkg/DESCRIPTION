Title: Generic Reproducible Parallel Backend for foreach
    Loops
Version: 1.4.5
Date: 2012-03-30
Author: Renaud Gaujoux
Maintainer: Renaud Gaujoux <renaud@cbio.uct.ac.za>
Description: This package provides functions to perform
    reproducible parallel foreach loops, using independent
    random streams as generated by L'Ecuyer's combined
    multiple-recursive generator [L'Ecuyer (1999)]. It
    enables to easily convert standard %dopar% loops into
    fully reproducible loops, independently of the number
    of workers, the task scheduling strategy, or the chosen
    parallel environment and associated foreach backend.
